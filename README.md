# TaskManagementApp

TaskManagementApp is a comprehensive task management platform designed to streamline project management activities, from task creation to tracking and assignment. Built with the T3 stack, this application integrates a modern frontend built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS, a serverless backend powered by SST on AWS, and a robust database using Supabase.

## Deployed Site

The application is deployed using AWS and SST. You can access the live version of the application at [https://d1mz4vajeg025u.cloudfront.net/](https://d1mz4vajeg025u.cloudfront.net/).

## Testing with Cypress

Cypress is used for end-to-end testing in this project. In addition to testing the main user interface, I have also added tests for utility functions found in the `appUtils` folder.

### Tests for `appUtils`

The `appUtils` folder contains important utility functions like `showSuccess` and `showError`. These functions are used to display success and error messages throughout the application. Hereâ€™s how you can run the tests:

### Install Cypress

1. **Install Cypress as a development dependency:**
    ```bash
    npm install cypress --save-dev
    ```
    or, if using Yarn:
    ```bash
    yarn add cypress --dev
    ```

### Run Cypress Tests

1. **Open Cypress Test Runner:**
    ```bash
    npx cypress open
    ```

2. **Run all tests:**
    The Test Runner will display all available tests, including those for the `appUtils` functions. Click on any test to run it.
